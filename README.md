Air-Quality-Monitoring-System:
This repository contains the arduino code required to program the hardware components to perform the task of collecting data from the surroundings and the uploading that data to the server dedicated for the job i.e. the AQM server.The data from the server can later be used for prediction or analysis purpose using Machine Learning Algorithms.
This is a group project done under the mentorship of Dr.Koel Datta Purkayastha.
